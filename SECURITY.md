# Security and Disclosure Policy

AgentLink is early-stage infrastructure research / product development. The production core is private.

## Public repository boundary

This showcase repository must not contain:

- passwords, API keys, tokens, cookies, or credentials
- private URLs, VPN addresses, internal hostnames, or private network topology
- customer or user data
- authentication bypass instructions
- detailed production authorization internals
- production source copied from the private core without explicit review

## Execution philosophy

Agent execution should follow least-authority principles. Sensitive operations may require stronger controls than ordinary read-only or reversible actions.

Important categories include:

- legal commitments
- financial transactions
- identity / KYC actions
- irreversible deletion or publication
- privileged infrastructure changes
- sensitive personal or customer data access

## Reporting a security issue

Do not publish a suspected vulnerability in a public GitHub Issue if it contains exploit details or sensitive information. Contact the project owner privately through the GitHub profile until a dedicated security contact is published.

## No security guarantee

Nothing in this repository should be interpreted as a certification, audit, or guarantee that AgentLink is suitable for production security-sensitive workloads today. Security hardening, formal threat modeling, and independent review are part of the development roadmap.
